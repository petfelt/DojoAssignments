<!-- TODO: Big bugs/features:
 - Homepage - Have parallax image be latest image. (For this: grab list of imgs by tag, then place latest img in background. Maybe have a default background behind that just in case?)
 - Make backgrounds for music & software pages for homepage - tiled backgrounds of album covers / xpendx icon.
 - Change homepage code to apply blur/tint to parallax images so text is more legible. (Goes with whole homepage rework.)
 - Make cloudinary upload more secure.
 - Google indexing? With hashtags or images / descriptions? Look into this.
 - Look into a place that sells posters, cards, of art. (fineartamerica looks great. Zazzle as backup.)


TODO: Update content:
 - Important update: Different galleries for photos & art.
 - Way to link to store page for each image?
 - Publish to social media from upload page? (Look into Buffer.) - Publish to everything. (Faceook, Insta, Twitter, Soundcloud.)


 TODO: Small bugs/changes:
 - Music page could look better.
 - Clean up homepage absolute text everywhere.
 - Remove pointless old code everywhere.

 - Make whole website more compatible with IE7 & IE8 / Other browsers  (Backups for all opacity & rgba values, etc.)
 - Homepage parallax images - Make text more legible for IE7 / IE8.
 - What happens when picture title or subtitle is really long?
 - Upload multiple images. (Make this less buggy, AkA be able to edit multiple at a time.)
 - Image deletion? Possibly more pain than it's worth. (Could give dad cloudinary access instead.)
 - Tooltips on upload page?

 TODO: BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
 - Email: LATER STAGE - make info@matthewfelton.com or similar as contact email.
 - Make sure all links go to correct websites.
 - Make SURE all files (cloudinary, mongoDB, etc.) files that need gitignore get it.

 TODO: Harmless bugs/changes:
 - Make homepage title an image instead of text? (Looks slightly different across browsers. Image would fix that.)
 - Make News button lose highlight after click. (Right now, it loses highlight after you move your mouse on page. Probably best it will get.)
 - Check photos & art pages to see if errors when no pictures exist. (Errors anyways...have scenario for no images.)


  TODO: NOTES: (Already dealt with, besides tooltips.)
  - Metadata can only be 1024 characters long. (Name & Caption)
  - Tags can only be 255 characters long. (Gallery name)



  TODO: Old ideas:
  - Way to sell art and images.  (Use shopify lite - see if that works out.) - client doesn't want shopify.
