            <p class="datatext">Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating,
              and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic
              approach of relational database or a non-relational database. Relationships mean a set of our&nbsp;&nbsp;
              data is related to another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-&nbsp;&nbsp; relational database there is not a
              common related section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data called schemas, inside
              each schema each data set is organized into tables, those tables contain columns and rows to house that
              particular set of data.</p>

            <p class="datatext">All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your&nbsp; harddrive,
              often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (think NSA styled).&nbsp;
              Our computer stores information on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the harddrive, we are able to create&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              new information, read information, update information and delete information.</p>

            <p class="datatext">Since there could potentially be a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of information a database stores one
              problem we might run into is finding&nbsp;&nbsp; the data we are looking for. Imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we had a room full of books
              and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book,
              checking the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title and moving onto the next until&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you found it. Thats very slow as most libraries
              discovered. Instead if we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were to ID each item we can find it quickly.</p>

            <p class="datatext">The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that holds
            onto all saved data. Well if only one user had access to that data its just like what we have built
            into our own computers, it wouldnt be useful to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other users. However the joy of having&nbsp;&nbsp; a database
            is that it is a storage bin&nbsp;&nbsp; many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleting
            information that all users would see.</p>

            <p class="datatext">There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information.
            As Big Data has erupted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said
            a lot of their software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB
            is completely free of cost and is used by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a large company called Facebook.</p>
